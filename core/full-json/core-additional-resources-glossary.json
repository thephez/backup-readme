Currently the most common way users exchange payment information.\n\n# Base58\n\nThe method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.\n\n# Base58check\n\nThe method used in Dash for converting 160-bit hashes into P2PKH and P2SH addresses. Also used in other parts of Dash, such as encoding private keys for backup in WIP format. Not the same as other base58 implementations.\n\n# BIP32\n\nThe Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy. Wallets using the HD protocol are called HD wallets.\n\n# BIP70 payment protocol\n\nThe protocol defined in BIP70 (and other BIPs) which lets spenders get signed payment details from receivers.\n\n# Block\n\nOne or more transactions prefaced by a block header and protected by proof of work. Blocks are the data stored on the block chain.\n\n# Block chain\n\nA chain of blocks with each block referencing the block that preceded it. The most-difficult-to-recreate chain is the best block chain.\n\n# Block header\n\nAn 80-byte header belonging to a single block which is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work.\n\n# Block height\n\nThe number of blocks preceding a particular block on a block chain. For example, the genesis block has a height of zero because zero block preceded it.\n\n# Block reward\n\nThe amount that miners may claim as a reward for creating a block. Equal to the sum of the block subsidy (newly available duffs) plus the transactions fees paid by transactions included in the block.\n\n# Block size limit\n\nThe maximum size in bytes that the consensus rules allow a block to be. The current block size limit is 2000000 bytes.\n\n# Blocks-first sync\n\nSynchronizing the block chain by downloading each block from a peer and then validating it.\n\n# blocktransactions\n\nA P2P Networking data structure used to provide some of the transactions in a block as requested.\n\n# blocktransactionsrequest\n\nA P2P Networking data structure used to list transaction indexes in a block being requested by a peer.\n\n# Bloom filter\n\nA filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only matching transactions and merkle blocks from full nodes.\n\n# Chain code\n\nIn HD wallets, 256 bits of entropy added to the public and private keys to help them generate secure child keys; the master chain code is usually derived from a seed along with the master private key\n\n# ChainLock\n\nChainLocks are a feature enabling near instant consensus on the valid chain. ChainLocks use Long-Living Masternode Quorums to mitigate 51 percent attacks and reduce uncertainty when receiving funds.\n\n# Change output\n\nAn output in a transaction which returns duffs to the spender, thus preventing too much of the input value from going to transaction fees.\n\n# Child key\n\nIn HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key. The key can be either a private key or a public key, and the key derivation may also require a chain code.\n\n# Child pays for parent\n\nSelecting transactions for mining not just based on their fees but also based on the fees of their ancestors (parents) and descendants (children).\n\n# Child private key\n\nIn HD wallets, a key derived from a parent key.

Can also happen as part of an attack.\n\n# Genesis block\n\nThe first block in the Dash block chain.\n\n# Hard fork\n\nA permanent divergence in the block chain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules.\n\n# Hardened extended key\n\nA variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys. This prevents compromise of the chain code plus any private key from putting the whole wallet at risk.\n\n# Hardened extended private key\n\nA variation on HD wallet extended keys where only the hardened extended private key can derive child keys. This prevents compromise of the chain code plus any private key from putting the whole wallet at risk.\n\n# HD wallet\n\nThe Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy.
