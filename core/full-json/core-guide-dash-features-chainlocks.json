If enough members (at least 240) see the same block as the first block, they will be able to create a [`clsig` message](core-ref-p2p-network-instantsend-messages#clsig) and propagate it to all <<glossary:nodes>> in the <<glossary:network>>.\n\nIf a valid [`clsig` message](core-ref-p2p-network-instantsend-messages#clsig) is received by a node, it must reject all blocks (and any descendants) at the same height that do not match the block specified in the [`clsig` message](core-ref-p2p-network-instantsend-messages#clsig). This makes the decision on the active chain quick, easy and unambiguous. It also makes reorganizations below this block impossible.\n\nWith LLMQ-based <<glossary:InstantSend>>, a ChainLock is only attempted once all <<glossary:transactions>> in the block are locked via InstantSend.
