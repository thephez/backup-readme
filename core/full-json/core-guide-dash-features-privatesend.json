For additional details, reference this [Official Documentation page](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#coinjoin).\n\nThe following video provides an overview with a good introduction to the details:\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\"></iframe>\n\n\n[block:embed]\n{\n  \"html\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\",\n  \"title\": \"How Dash's 'PrivateSend' Works Under the Hood\",\n  \"favicon\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/favicon.ico\",\n  \"provider\": \"youtube-nocookie.com\",\n  \"href\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\",\n  \"height\": \"350px\",\n  \"width\": \"100%\",\n  \"iframe\": true\n}\n[/block]\n\n\n\n\n# Wallet Preparation\n\nThe <<glossary:wallet>> completes two operations in this phase:\n\n1. Split value into inputs matching the CoinJoin <<glossary:denominations>> by sending <<glossary:transactions>> to itself\n\n2. Split value into <<glossary:inputs>> to use for collateral by sending transactions to itself\n\n**Note**: Both these operations incur the standard <<glossary:transaction fee>> like any other transaction\n\n**Creating Denominations**\n\nThe CoinJoin denominations include a bit mapping to easily differentiate them. The [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) and [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) use this bit shifted integer instead of sending the actual denomination. The table below lists the bit, its associated integer value used in P2P messages, and the actual Dash value.\n\n| **Bit** | **Denom. (Integer)** | **Denomination (DASH)** |\n| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| 0       | 1                    | 10.0001                 |\n| 1       | 2                    | 01.00001                |\n| 2       | 4                    | 00.100001               |\n| 3       | 8                    | 00.0100001              |\n| 4       | 16                   | 00.00100001             |\n\nProtocol version 70213 added a 5th denomination (0.001 DASH).\n\n[Example Testnet denomination creation transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/f0174fc87d68a18617c2990df4d9455c0459c601d2d6473934357a66f9b8b70a)\n\n**Creating Collaterals**\n\nCollaterals are used to pay CoinJoin fees, but are kept separate from the denominations to maximize privacy. Since protocol version 70213, the minimum collateral fee is 1/10 of the smallest denomination for all sessions regardless of denomination. In Dash Core, collaterals are created with enough value to pay 4 collateral fees (4 x 0.001 DASH). ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L459))\n\nIn protocol version 70208, collateral inputs can be anything from 2x the minimum collateral amount to the maximum collateral amount (currently defined as 4x the minimum collateral). In protocol versions > 70208, Dash Core can use any <<glossary:input>> from 1x the minimum collateral amount to the maximum collateral amount.\n\n[Example Testnet collateral creation transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/8f9b15973983876f7ce4eb2c32b09690dfb0432d2caf6c6df516196a8d17689f)\n\n[Example Testnet collateral payment transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/de51e6f7c5ef75aad0dbb0a808ef4873d7ef6d67b25f3a658d5a241db4f3eeeb)\n\n# CoinJoin Processing\n\nThis phase involves exchanging a sequence of messages with a <<glossary:masternode>> so it can construct a denominate transaction with inputs from the clients in its pool.\n\n_Data Flow_\n\n|    | **Clients**                                                            | **Direction** | **Masternode**                                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0  |                                                                        |               |                                                                  | Client determines whether to join an existing pool or create a new one                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 1  | [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa)         |       \u2192       |                                                                  | Client asks to join pool or have the masternode create a new one                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 2  |                                                                        |       \u2190       | [`dssu` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dssu) | Masternode provides a pool status update (Typical -

Pool Selection**_\n\n- Existing pool information is derived from the Queue messages seen by the client\n- Dash Core attempts to join an existing pool and only requests creation of a new one if that fails, although this is not a requirement that alternative implementations would be required to follow\n\n_**Step 1 - Pool Request**_\n\n- The [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) contains a collateral transaction\n  - This transaction uses a collateral <<glossary:input>> created in the [Wallet Preparation](#wallet-preparation) phase\n  - The collateral is a signed <<glossary:transaction>> that pays the collateral back to a client <<glossary:address>> minus a fee of 0.001 DASH\n\n_**Step 3 - Queue**_\n\n- A masternode broadcasts [`dsq` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) when it starts a new queue. These message are relayed by all <<glossary:peers>>.\n- As of protocol version 70214, sessions have a variable number of participants defined by the range `nPoolMinParticipants` ([3](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/chainparams.cpp#L360)) to `nPoolMaxParticipants` ([5](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/chainparams.cpp#L361)). Prior protocol version sessions always contained exactly 3 participants. Spork 22 introduced in Dash Core 0.16.0 expanded the maximum number of participants to 20 and also reduced the minimum number of participants to 2 for testnet/devnet/regtest networks. The spork was removed in Dash Core 0.17.0 which made the change permanent.\n- The masternode sends a [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) with the ready bit set once it has received valid [`dsa` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) from either:\n  1. The maximum number of clients (20)\n  2. Greater than the minimum number of clients (3) and the timeout has been reached ([30 seconds](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.16.x/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L23))\n\n> \ud83d\udea7 \n> \n> Clients must respond to the Queue ready within 30 seconds or risk forfeiting the collateral they provided in the [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) (Step 1) ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.16.x/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L23))\n\n_**Step 4 - Inputs**_\n\n- The collateral transaction can be the same in the [`dsi` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) as the one in the [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) (Step 1) as long as it has not been spent\n- Each client can provide up to 9 (`COINJOIN_ENTRY_MAX_SIZE`) inputs (and an equal number of outputs) to be used ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L29))\n- This is the only message in the process that contains enough information to link a wallet's CoinJoin inputs with its outputs\n  - This message is sent directly between a client and the masternode processing the session (not relayed across the Dash network) so no other clients see it\n\n_**Step 6 - Final Transaction (unsigned)**_\n\n- Once the masternode has received valid [`dsi` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) from all clients, it creates the final transaction and sends a [`dsf` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsf)\n  - Inputs/outputs are ordered deterministically as defined by [BIP-69](https://github.com/dashevo/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki#Abstract) to avoid leaking any data ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend-server.cpp#L271-L272))\n  - Clients must sign their inputs to the Final Transaction within 15 seconds or risk forfeiting the collateral they provided in the [`dsi` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) (Step 4) ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L24))\n\n_**Step 10 - Final Transaction broadcast**_\n\n- Prior to protocol version 70213, masternodes could only send a single un-mined [`dstx` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) at a time. As of protocol version 70213, up to 5 (`MASTERNODE_MAX_MIXING_TXES`) un-mined [`dstx` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) per masternode are allowed. ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/masternode/masternode-meta.h#L16))\n\n_**General**_\n\n  With the exception of the [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) and the [`dstx` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) (which need to be public and do not expose any private information), all CoinJoin P2P messages are sent directly between the masternode processing the transaction and the relevant client(s).\n\n# Fees\n\n**Processing Fees**\n\n- If processing completes successfully, Dash Core charges the collateral randomly in 1/10 denominate transactions to pay miners ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.17.0.0/src/coinjoin/coinjoin-server.cpp#L427-L444))\n- Clients that abuse the system by failing to respond to [`dsq` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) or [`dsf` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsf) within the timeout periods may forfeit their collateral. Dash Core charges the abuse fee in 1/3 cases ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.17.0.0/src/coinjoin/coinjoin-server.cpp#L357-L374))\n\n**Sending Fees**\n\nTo maintain privacy when using CoinJoin funds, transactions must fully spend all inputs to a single output (with the remainder becoming the fee - i.e. no <<glossary:change output>>). This can result in large fees depending on the value being sent.\n\nFor example, an extreme case is sending the minimum non-dust value (546 duffs). This results in an extremely large transaction fee because the minimum denomination (0.00100001 DASH or 100,001 duffs) must be fully spent with no change. This results in a fee of 0.00999464 DASH and a sent value of only 0.00000546 DASH as shown by the calculation below.\n\n100001 duffs (smallest CoinJoin denomination) - 546 duffs (value to send) = 99455 duffs (fee)",

For additional details, reference this [Official Documentation page](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#coinjoin).\n\nThe following video provides an overview with a good introduction to the details:\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\"></iframe>\n\n\n[block:embed]\n{\n  \"html\": false,\n  \"url\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\",\n  \"title\": \"How Dash's 'PrivateSend' Works Under the Hood\",\n  \"favicon\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/favicon.ico\",\n  \"provider\": \"youtube-nocookie.com\",\n  \"href\": \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vgCId3wJc5Y?rel=0\",\n  \"height\": \"350px\",\n  \"width\": \"100%\",\n  \"iframe\": true\n}\n[/block]\n\n\n\n\n# Wallet Preparation\n\nThe <<glossary:wallet>> completes two operations in this phase:\n\n1. Split value into inputs matching the CoinJoin <<glossary:denominations>> by sending <<glossary:transactions>> to itself\n\n2. Split value into <<glossary:inputs>> to use for collateral by sending transactions to itself\n\n**Note**: Both these operations incur the standard <<glossary:transaction fee>> like any other transaction\n\n**Creating Denominations**\n\nThe CoinJoin denominations include a bit mapping to easily differentiate them. The [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) and [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) use this bit shifted integer instead of sending the actual denomination. The table below lists the bit, its associated integer value used in P2P messages, and the actual Dash value.\n\n| **Bit** | **Denom. (Integer)** | **Denomination (DASH)** |\n| ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| 0       | 1                    | 10.0001                 |\n| 1       | 2                    | 01.00001                |\n| 2       | 4                    | 00.100001               |\n| 3       | 8                    | 00.0100001              |\n| 4       | 16                   | 00.00100001             |\n\nProtocol version 70213 added a 5th denomination (0.001 DASH).\n\n[Example Testnet denomination creation transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/f0174fc87d68a18617c2990df4d9455c0459c601d2d6473934357a66f9b8b70a)\n\n**Creating Collaterals**\n\nCollaterals are used to pay CoinJoin fees, but are kept separate from the denominations to maximize privacy. Since protocol version 70213, the minimum collateral fee is 1/10 of the smallest denomination for all sessions regardless of denomination. In Dash Core, collaterals are created with enough value to pay 4 collateral fees (4 x 0.001 DASH). ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L459))\n\nIn protocol version 70208, collateral inputs can be anything from 2x the minimum collateral amount to the maximum collateral amount (currently defined as 4x the minimum collateral). In protocol versions > 70208, Dash Core can use any <<glossary:input>> from 1x the minimum collateral amount to the maximum collateral amount.\n\n[Example Testnet collateral creation transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/8f9b15973983876f7ce4eb2c32b09690dfb0432d2caf6c6df516196a8d17689f)\n\n[Example Testnet collateral payment transaction](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/tx/de51e6f7c5ef75aad0dbb0a808ef4873d7ef6d67b25f3a658d5a241db4f3eeeb)\n\n# CoinJoin Processing\n\nThis phase involves exchanging a sequence of messages with a <<glossary:masternode>> so it can construct a denominate transaction with inputs from the clients in its pool.\n\n_Data Flow_\n\n|    | **Clients**                                                            | **Direction** | **Masternode**                                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0  |                                                                        |               |                                                                  | Client determines whether to join an existing pool or create a new one                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 1  | [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa)         |       \u2192       |                                                                  | Client asks to join pool or have the masternode create a new one                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 2  |                                                                        |       \u2190       | [`dssu` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dssu) | Masternode provides a pool status update (Typical -

Pool Selection**_\n\n- Existing pool information is derived from the Queue messages seen by the client\n- Dash Core attempts to join an existing pool and only requests creation of a new one if that fails, although this is not a requirement that alternative implementations would be required to follow\n\n_**Step 1 - Pool Request**_\n\n- The [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) contains a collateral transaction\n  - This transaction uses a collateral <<glossary:input>> created in the [Wallet Preparation](#wallet-preparation) phase\n  - The collateral is a signed <<glossary:transaction>> that pays the collateral back to a client <<glossary:address>> minus a fee of 0.001 DASH\n\n_**Step 3 - Queue**_\n\n- A masternode broadcasts [`dsq` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) when it starts a new queue. These message are relayed by all <<glossary:peers>>.\n- As of protocol version 70214, sessions have a variable number of participants defined by the range `nPoolMinParticipants` ([3](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/chainparams.cpp#L360)) to `nPoolMaxParticipants` ([5](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/chainparams.cpp#L361)). Prior protocol version sessions always contained exactly 3 participants. Spork 22 introduced in Dash Core 0.16.0 expanded the maximum number of participants to 20 and also reduced the minimum number of participants to 2 for testnet/devnet/regtest networks. The spork was removed in Dash Core 0.17.0 which made the change permanent.\n- The masternode sends a [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) with the ready bit set once it has received valid [`dsa` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) from either:\n  1. The maximum number of clients (20)\n  2. Greater than the minimum number of clients (3) and the timeout has been reached ([30 seconds](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.16.x/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L23))\n\n> \ud83d\udea7 \n> \n> Clients must respond to the Queue ready within 30 seconds or risk forfeiting the collateral they provided in the [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) (Step 1) ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.16.x/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L23))\n\n_**Step 4 - Inputs**_\n\n- The collateral transaction can be the same in the [`dsi` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) as the one in the [`dsa` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsa) (Step 1) as long as it has not been spent\n- Each client can provide up to 9 (`COINJOIN_ENTRY_MAX_SIZE`) inputs (and an equal number of outputs) to be used ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L29))\n- This is the only message in the process that contains enough information to link a wallet's CoinJoin inputs with its outputs\n  - This message is sent directly between a client and the masternode processing the session (not relayed across the Dash network) so no other clients see it\n\n_**Step 6 - Final Transaction (unsigned)**_\n\n- Once the masternode has received valid [`dsi` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) from all clients, it creates the final transaction and sends a [`dsf` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsf)\n  - Inputs/outputs are ordered deterministically as defined by [BIP-69](https://github.com/dashevo/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki#Abstract) to avoid leaking any data ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend-server.cpp#L271-L272))\n  - Clients must sign their inputs to the Final Transaction within 15 seconds or risk forfeiting the collateral they provided in the [`dsi` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsi) (Step 4) ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/privatesend/privatesend.h#L24))\n\n_**Step 10 - Final Transaction broadcast**_\n\n- Prior to protocol version 70213, masternodes could only send a single un-mined [`dstx` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) at a time. As of protocol version 70213, up to 5 (`MASTERNODE_MAX_MIXING_TXES`) un-mined [`dstx` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) per masternode are allowed. ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.0.0/src/masternode/masternode-meta.h#L16))\n\n_**General**_\n\n  With the exception of the [`dsq` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) and the [`dstx` message](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dstx) (which need to be public and do not expose any private information), all CoinJoin P2P messages are sent directly between the masternode processing the transaction and the relevant client(s).\n\n# Fees\n\n**Processing Fees**\n\n- If processing completes successfully, Dash Core charges the collateral randomly in 1/10 denominate transactions to pay miners ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.17.0.0/src/coinjoin/coinjoin-server.cpp#L427-L444))\n- Clients that abuse the system by failing to respond to [`dsq` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsq) or [`dsf` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-privatesend-messages#dsf) within the timeout periods may forfeit their collateral. Dash Core charges the abuse fee in 1/3 cases ([Dash Core Reference](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.17.0.0/src/coinjoin/coinjoin-server.cpp#L357-L374))\n\n**Sending Fees**\n\nTo maintain privacy when using CoinJoin funds, transactions must fully spend all inputs to a single output (with the remainder becoming the fee - i.e. no <<glossary:change output>>). This can result in large fees depending on the value being sent.\n\nFor example, an extreme case is sending the minimum non-dust value (546 duffs). This results in an extremely large transaction fee because the minimum denomination (0.00100001 DASH or 100,001 duffs) must be fully spent with no change. This results in a fee of 0.00999464 DASH and a sent value of only 0.00000546 DASH as shown by the calculation below.\n\n100001 duffs (smallest CoinJoin denomination) - 546 duffs (value to send) = 99455 duffs (fee)"
