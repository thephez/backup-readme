Once banned, the masternode can only be restored by sending a Provider Update Service ([ProUpServTx](core-ref-transactions-special-transactions#proupservtx)) special transaction.\n\n| PoSe Parameter | Value | Example Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Maximum PoSe Score | Number of registered masternodes | 5000 |\n| PoSe Score Increases | Maximum PoSe Score * 2/3 | 3333 |\n| PoSe Score Decreases | 1 (per block) | Always `1` |\n\nThe current PoSe scoring algorithm increases the PoSe score by 66% of the maximum score for each failed DKG session.

This happens since a sufficient number of blocks are mined prior to the second failure to drop the PoSe score below the threshold (`< 5000 - 3333`) that would result in banning.\n\n- In the second 5000 block cycle, the second DKG failure occurs too close to the first and results in the PoSe score exceeding the maximum limit.
