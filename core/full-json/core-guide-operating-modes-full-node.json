This security model assures the validity of the <<glossary:block chain>> by downloading and validating <<glossary:blocks>> from the <<glossary:genesis block>> all the way to the most recently discovered block.

Due to the computational difficulty required to generate a new block at the tip of the chain, the ability to fool a full node becomes very expensive after 6 <<glossary:confirmations>>.
