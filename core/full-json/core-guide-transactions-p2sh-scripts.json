Bob creates a redeem script with whatever script he wants, hashes the redeem script, and provides the <<glossary:redeem script>> hash to Alice.

The peer-to-peer <<glossary:network>> ensures the full redeem script hashes to the same value as the script hash Alice put in her output; it then processes the redeem script exactly as it would if it were the primary pubkey script, letting Bob spend the output if the redeem script does not return false.\n\n![Unlocking A P2SH Output For Spending](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-unlocking-p2sh-output.svg)\n\nThe hash of the redeem script has the same properties as a pubkey hash---so it can be transformed into the standard Dash address format with only one small change to differentiate it from a standard address.
