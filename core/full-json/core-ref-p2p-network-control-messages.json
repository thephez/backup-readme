Each peer which wants to accept incoming connections creates an [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) providing its connection information and then sends that message to its peers unsolicited. Some of its peers send that information to their peers (also unsolicited), some of which further distribute it, allowing decentralized peer discovery for any program already on the network.\n\nAn [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) may also be sent in response to a [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr).\n\n| Bytes      | Name             | Data Type          | Description\n|------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------\n| *Varies*   | IP address count | compactSize uint   | The number of IP address entries up to a maximum of 1,000.\n| *Varies*   | IP addresses     | network IP address | IP address entries.

The element is sent directly to the receiving peer; the peer then uses the parameters set in the [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) to add the element to the bloom filter.\n\nBecause the element is sent directly to the receiving peer, there is no obfuscation of the element and none of the plausible-deniability privacy provided by the bloom filter. Clients that want to maintain greater privacy should recalculate the bloom filter themselves and send a new [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) with the recalculated bloom filter.\n\n| Bytes    | Name          | Data Type        | Description\n|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------\n| *Varies* | element bytes | compactSize uint | The number of bytes in the following element field.\n| *Varies* | element       | uint8_t[]        | The element to add to the current filter.  Maximum of 520 bytes, which is the maximum size of an element which can be pushed onto the stack in a pubkey or signature script.  Elements must be sent in the byte order they would use when appearing in a raw transaction; for example, hashes should be sent in internal byte order.\n\nNote: a [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd) will not be accepted unless a filter was previously set with the [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload).\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd) adding a <<glossary:TXID>>. (The message header has been omitted.) This TXID appears in the same block used for the example hexdump in the [`merkleblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#merkleblock); if that [`merkleblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#merkleblock) is re-sent after sending this [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd), six hashes are returned instead of four.\n\n``` text\n20 .................................

Element (A TXID)\n```\n\n# filterclear\n\n*Added in protocol version 70001 as described by BIP37.*\n\nThe [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> to remove a previously-set <<glossary:bloom filter>>.  This also undoes the effect of setting the relay field in the [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) to 0, allowing unfiltered access to [`inv` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv) announcing new transactions.\n\nDash Core does not require a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear) before a replacement filter is loaded with `filterload`.  It also doesn't require a [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) before a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear).\n\nThere is no payload in a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# filterload\n\n*Added in protocol version 70001 as described by BIP37.*\n\nThe [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> to filter all relayed transactions and requested <<glossary:merkle blocks>> through the provided filter. This allows clients to receive transactions relevant to their <<glossary:wallet>> plus a configurable rate of false positive transactions which can provide plausible-deniability privacy.\n\n| Bytes    | Name         | Data Type | Description\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------\n| *Varies* | nFilterBytes | compactSize uint | Number of bytes in the following filter bit field.\n| *Varies* | filter       | uint8_t[] | A bit field of arbitrary byte-aligned size.

The maximum value allowed in this field is 50.\n| 4        | nTweak       | uint32_t  | An arbitrary value to add to the seed value in the hash function used by the bloom filter.\n| 1        | nFlags       | uint8_t   | A set of flags that control how outpoints corresponding to a matched pubkey script are added to the filter. See the table in the Updating A Bloom Filter subsection below.\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload). (The message header has been omitted.)  For an example of how this payload was created, see the [filterload example](core-examples-p2p-network-creating-a-bloom-filter).\n\n``` text\n02 ......... Filter bytes: 2\nb50f ....... Filter: 1010 1101 1111 0000\n0b000000 ... nHashFuncs: 11\n00000000 ... nTweak: 0/none\n00 ......... nFlags: BLOOM_UPDATE_NONE\n```\n\n## Initializing A Bloom Filter\n\nFilters have two core parameters: the size of the bit field and the number of hash functions to run against each data element. The following formulas from BIP37 will allow you to automatically select appropriate values based on the number of elements you plan to insert into the filter (*n*) and the false positive rate (*p*) you desire to maintain plausible deniability.\n\n* Size of the bit field in bytes (*nFilterBytes*), up to a maximum of 36,000: `(-1 / log(2)**2 * n * log(p)) / 8`\n\n* Hash functions to use (*nHashFuncs*), up to a maximum of 50:\n  `nFilterBytes * 8 / n * log(2)`\n\nNote that the filter matches parts of transactions (transaction elements), so the false positive rate is relative to the number of elements checked---not the number of transactions checked. Each normal transaction has a minimum of four matchable elements (described in the comparison subsection below), so a filter with a false-positive rate of 1 percent will match about 4 percent of all transactions at a minimum.\n\nAccording to BIP37, the formulas and limits described above provide support for bloom filters containing 20,000 items with a false positive rate of less than 0.1 percent or 10,000 items with a false positive rate of less than 0.0001 percent.\n\nOnce the size of the bit field is known, the bit field should be initialized as all zeroes.\n\n## Populating A Bloom Filter\n\nThe bloom filter is populated using between 1 and 50 unique hash functions (the number specified per filter by the *nHashFuncs* field). Instead of using up to 50 different hash function implementations, a single implementation is used with a unique seed value for each function.\n\nThe seed is `nHashNum * 0xfba4c795 + nTweak` as a *uint32\\_t*, where the values are:\n\n* **nHashNum** is the sequence number for this hash function, starting at 0 for the first hash iteration and increasing up to the value of the *nHashFuncs* field (minus one) for the last hash iteration.\n\n* **0xfba4c795** is a constant optimized to create large differences in the seed for different values of *nHashNum*.\n\n* **nTweak** is a per-filter constant set by the client to require the use of an arbitrary set of hash functions.\n\nIf the seed resulting from the formula above is larger than four bytes, it must be truncated to its four most significant bytes (for example, `0x8967452301 & 0xffffffff \u2192 0x67452301`).\n\nThe actual hash function implementation used is the [32-bit Murmur3 hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash).\n\n> \ud83d\udea7 Murmer3 Version\n>\n> **Warning:** the Murmur3 hash function has separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions that produce different results for the same <<glossary:input>>.  Only the 32-bit Murmur3 version is used with Dash bloom filters.\n\nThe data to be hashed can be any transaction element which the bloom filter can match. See the next subsection for the list of transaction elements checked against the filter. The largest element which can be matched is a script data push of 520 bytes, so the data should never exceed 520 bytes.\n\nThe example below from Dash Core [bloom.cpp](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.x/src/bloom.cpp#L59) combines all the steps above to create the hash function template. The seed is the first parameter; the data to be hashed is the second parameter. The result is a uint32\\_t modulo the size of the bit field in bits.\n\n``` c++\nMurmurHash3(nHashNum * 0xFBA4C795 + nTweak, vDataToHash) % (vData.size() * 8)\n```\n\nEach data element to be added to the filter is hashed by *nHashFuncs* number of hash functions. Each time a hash function is run, the result will be the index number (*nIndex*) of a bit in the bit field. That bit must be set to 1. For example if the filter bit field was `00000000` and the result is 5, the revised filter bit field is `00000100` (the first bit is bit 0).\n\nIt is expected that sometimes the same index number will be returned more than once when populating the bit field; this does not affect the algorithm---after a bit is set to 1, it is never changed back to 0.\n\nAfter all data elements have been added to the filter, each set of eight bits is converted into a little-endian byte. These bytes are the value of the *filter* field.\n\n## Comparing Transaction Elements To A Bloom Filter\n\nTo compare an arbitrary data element against the bloom filter, it is hashed using the same parameters used to create the bloom filter. Specifically, it is hashed *nHashFuncs* times, each time using the same\n*nTweak* provided in the filter, and the resulting <<glossary:output>> is modulo the size of the bit field provided in the *filter* field.  After each hash is performed, the filter is checked to see if the bit at that indexed location is set.  For example if the result of a hash is `5` and the filter is `01001110`, the bit is considered set.\n\nIf the result of every hash points to a set bit, the filter matches. If any of the results points to an unset bit, the filter does not match.\n\nThe following transaction elements are compared against bloom filters. All elements will be hashed in the byte order used in <<glossary:blocks>> (for example, <<glossary:TXIDs>> will be in <<glossary:internal byte order>>).\n\n* **TXIDs:** the transaction's SHA256(SHA256()) hash.\n\n* **Outpoints:** each 36-byte <<glossary:outpoint>> used this transaction's input section is individually compared to the filter.\n\n* **Signature Script Data:** each element pushed onto the stack by a <<glossary:data-pushing opcode>> in a <<glossary:signature script>> from this transaction is individually compared to the filter.  This includes data elements present in P2SH <<glossary:redeem script>> when they are being spent.\n\n* **PubKey Script Data:** each element pushed onto the the stack by a data-pushing opcode in any <<glossary:pubkey script>> from this transaction is individually compared to the filter. (If a pubkey script element matches the filter, the filter will be immediately updated if the `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL` flag was set; if the pubkey script is in the P2PKH format and matches the filter, the filter will be immediately updated if the `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY` flag was set. See the subsection below for details.)\n\nAs of  Dash Core 0.14.0, elements in the extra payload section of [DIP2](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md)-based <<glossary:special transactions>> are also compared against bloom filters.\n\nThe following annotated hexdump of a transaction is from the [raw transaction format section](core-ref-transactions-raw-transaction-format); the elements which would be checked by the filter are emphasized in bold. Note that this transaction's TXID (**`01000000017b1eab[...]`**) would also be checked, and that the outpoint TXID and index number below would be checked as a single 36-byte element.\n\n<pre><code>01000000 ...................................

When the filtering node sees a <<glossary:pubkey script>> that pays a pubkey, <<glossary:address>>, or other data element matching the filter, the filtering node immediately updates the filter with the <<glossary:outpoint>> corresponding to that pubkey script.\n\n![Automatically Updating Bloom Filters](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-bloom-update.svg)\n\nIf an input later spends that outpoint, the filter will match it, allowing the filtering node to tell the client that one of its transaction outputs has been spent.\n\nThe *nFlags* field has three allowed values:\n\n| Value | Name                       | Description\n|-------|----------------------------|---------------\n| 0     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_NONE`          | The filtering node should not update the filter.\n| 1     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL`           | If the filter matches any data element in a pubkey script, the corresponding outpoint is added to the filter.\n| 2     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY` | If the filter matches any data element in a pubkey script and that script is either a P2PKH or non-P2SH pay-to-multisig script, the corresponding outpoint is added to the filter.\n\nIn addition, because the filter size stays the same even though additional elements are being added to it, the false positive rate increases. Each false positive can result in another element being added to the filter, creating a feedback loop that can (after a certain point) make the filter useless. For this reason, clients using automatic filter updates need to monitor the actual false positive rate and send a new filter when the rate gets too high.\n\n# getaddr\n\nThe [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr) requests an [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) from the receiving <<glossary:node>>, preferably one with lots of IP addresses of other receiving nodes. The transmitting node can use those IP addresses to quickly update its database of available nodes rather than waiting for unsolicited [`addr` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) to arrive over time.\n\nThere is no payload in a [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# getsporks\n\nThe [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks) requests [`spork` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) from the receiving node.\n\nThere is no payload in a [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# ping\n\nThe [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) helps confirm that the receiving <<glossary:peer>> is still connected. If a TCP/IP error is encountered when sending the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) (such as a connection timeout), the transmitting node can assume that the receiving node is disconnected. The response to a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) is the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong).\n\nBefore protocol version 60000, the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) had no payload. As of protocol version 60001 and all later versions, the message includes a single field, the nonce.\n\n| Bytes | Name  | Data Type | Description\n|-------|-------|-----------|---------------\n| 8     | nonce | uint64_t  | *Added in protocol version 60001 as described by BIP31.* <br><br>Random nonce assigned to this [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping).  The responding [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) will include this nonce to identify the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) to which it is replying.\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping). (The message header has been omitted.)\n\n``` text\n0094102111e2af4d ... Nonce\n```\n\n# pong\n\n*Added in protocol version 60001 as described by BIP31.*\n\nThe [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) replies to a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping), proving to the pinging <<glossary:node>> that the ponging node is still alive. Dash Core will, by default, disconnect from any clients which have not responded to a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) within 20 minutes.\n\nTo allow nodes to keep track of latency, the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) sends back the same nonce received in the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) it is replying to.\n\nThe format of the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) is identical to the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping); only the message header differs.\n\n# sendaddrv2\n\n*Added in protocol version 70220 of Dash Core*\n\nThe `sendaddrv2` message signals support for receiving [`addrv2` messages](#addrv2) (defined in [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki)). It also implies that its sender can encode as `addrv2` and would send `addrv2` messages instead of [`addr` messages](#addr) to a peer that has signaled `addrv2` support by sending a `sendaddrv2` message.\n\nThere is no payload in a `sendaddrv2` message. See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# sendcmpct\n\n*Added in protocol version 70209 of Dash Core as described by BIP152*\n\nThe [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> whether or not to announce new <<glossary:blocks>> using a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock). It also sends the compact block protocol version it supports. The [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) is defined as a message containing a 1-byte integer followed by a 8-byte integer. The first integer is interpreted as a boolean and should have a value of either 1 or 0. The second integer is be interpreted as a little-endian version number.\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the first and second integers set to 1, the <<glossary:node>> should announce new blocks by sending a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock).\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the first integer set to 0, the node shouldn't announce new blocks by sending a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock), but instead announce new blocks by sending invs or <<glossary:headers>>, as defined by [BIP130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki).\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the second integer set to something other than 1, nodes should treat the peer as if they had not received the message (as it indicates the peer will provide an unexpected encoding in [`cmpctblock` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock), and/or other, messages). This allows future versions to send duplicate [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with different versions as a part of a version handshake.\n\nNodes should check for a protocol version of >= 70209 before sending [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct). Nodes shouldn't send a request for a `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` object to a peer before having received a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) from that peer. Nodes shouldn't request a `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` object before having sent all [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) to that peer which they intend to send, as the peer cannot know what protocol version to use in the response.\n\nThe structure of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) is defined below.\n\n| Bytes    | Name          | Data Type        | Description\n|----------|---------------|------------------|--------------\n| 1        | announce      | bool             | 0 - Announce blocks via [`headers` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#headers) or [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv)<br>1 - Announce blocks via [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock)\n| 8        | version       | uint64_t         | The compact block protocol version number\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct).

See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# sendheaders2\n\n*Added in protocol version 70223 of Dash Core.*\n\nThe [`sendheaders2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendheaders2) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> to send new <<glossary:block>> announcements using a [`headers2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#headers2) rather than an [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv).\n\nThere is no payload in a [`sendheaders2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendheaders2).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# spork\n\nSporks are a mechanism by which updated code is released to the network, but not immediately made active (or \u201cenforced\u201d). Enforcement of the updated code can be activated remotely. Should problems arise, the code can be deactivated in the same manner, without the need for a network-wide rollback or client update.\n\nA [`spork` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) may be sent in response to a [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks).\n\nThe [`spork` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) tells the receiving peer the status of the spork defined by the SporkID field.

The [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack) has no payload; for an example of a message with no payload, see the [message headers section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers).\n\n# version\n\nThe [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) provides information about the transmitting <<glossary:node>> to the receiving node at the beginning of a connection. Until both <<glossary:peers>> have exchanged [`version` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version), no other messages will be accepted.\n\nIf a [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) is accepted, the receiving node should send a [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack)---but no node should send a [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack) before initializing its half of the connection by first sending a [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version).\n\nProtocol version 70214 added a <<glossary:masternode>> authentication (challenge/response) system.

Each peer which wants to accept incoming connections creates an [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) providing its connection information and then sends that message to its peers unsolicited. Some of its peers send that information to their peers (also unsolicited), some of which further distribute it, allowing decentralized peer discovery for any program already on the network.\n\nAn [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) may also be sent in response to a [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr).\n\n| Bytes      | Name             | Data Type          | Description\n|------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------\n| *Varies*   | IP address count | compactSize uint   | The number of IP address entries up to a maximum of 1,000.\n| *Varies*   | IP addresses     | network IP address | IP address entries.

The element is sent directly to the receiving peer; the peer then uses the parameters set in the [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) to add the element to the bloom filter.\n\nBecause the element is sent directly to the receiving peer, there is no obfuscation of the element and none of the plausible-deniability privacy provided by the bloom filter. Clients that want to maintain greater privacy should recalculate the bloom filter themselves and send a new [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) with the recalculated bloom filter.\n\n| Bytes    | Name          | Data Type        | Description\n|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------\n| *Varies* | element bytes | compactSize uint | The number of bytes in the following element field.\n| *Varies* | element       | uint8_t[]        | The element to add to the current filter.  Maximum of 520 bytes, which is the maximum size of an element which can be pushed onto the stack in a pubkey or signature script.  Elements must be sent in the byte order they would use when appearing in a raw transaction; for example, hashes should be sent in internal byte order.\n\nNote: a [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd) will not be accepted unless a filter was previously set with the [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload).\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd) adding a <<glossary:TXID>>. (The message header has been omitted.) This TXID appears in the same block used for the example hexdump in the [`merkleblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#merkleblock); if that [`merkleblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#merkleblock) is re-sent after sending this [`filteradd` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filteradd), six hashes are returned instead of four.\n\n``` text\n20 .................................

This also undoes the effect of setting the relay field in the [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) to 0, allowing unfiltered access to [`inv` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv) announcing new transactions.\n\nDash Core does not require a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear) before a replacement filter is loaded with `filterload`.  It also doesn't require a [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) before a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear).\n\nThere is no payload in a [`filterclear` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterclear).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# filterload\n\n*Added in protocol version 70001 as described by BIP37.*\n\nThe [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> to filter all relayed transactions and requested <<glossary:merkle blocks>> through the provided filter. This allows clients to receive transactions relevant to their <<glossary:wallet>> plus a configurable rate of false positive transactions which can provide plausible-deniability privacy.\n\n| Bytes    | Name         | Data Type | Description\n|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------\n| *Varies* | nFilterBytes | compactSize uint | Number of bytes in the following filter bit field.\n| *Varies* | filter       | uint8_t[] | A bit field of arbitrary byte-aligned size.

See the table in the Updating A Bloom Filter subsection below.\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`filterload` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#filterload). (The message header has been omitted.)  For an example of how this payload was created, see the [filterload example](core-examples-p2p-network-creating-a-bloom-filter).\n\n``` text\n02 ......... Filter bytes: 2\nb50f ....... Filter: 1010 1101 1111 0000\n0b000000 ... nHashFuncs: 11\n00000000 ... nTweak: 0/none\n00 ......... nFlags: BLOOM_UPDATE_NONE\n```\n\n## Initializing A Bloom Filter\n\nFilters have two core parameters: the size of the bit field and the number of hash functions to run against each data element. The following formulas from BIP37 will allow you to automatically select appropriate values based on the number of elements you plan to insert into the filter (*n*) and the false positive rate (*p*) you desire to maintain plausible deniability.\n\n* Size of the bit field in bytes (*nFilterBytes*), up to a maximum of 36,000: `(-1 / log(2)**2 * n * log(p)) / 8`\n\n* Hash functions to use (*nHashFuncs*), up to a maximum of 50:\n  `nFilterBytes * 8 / n * log(2)`\n\nNote that the filter matches parts of transactions (transaction elements), so the false positive rate is relative to the number of elements checked---not the number of transactions checked. Each normal transaction has a minimum of four matchable elements (described in the comparison subsection below), so a filter with a false-positive rate of 1 percent will match about 4 percent of all transactions at a minimum.\n\nAccording to BIP37, the formulas and limits described above provide support for bloom filters containing 20,000 items with a false positive rate of less than 0.1 percent or 10,000 items with a false positive rate of less than 0.0001 percent.\n\nOnce the size of the bit field is known, the bit field should be initialized as all zeroes.\n\n## Populating A Bloom Filter\n\nThe bloom filter is populated using between 1 and 50 unique hash functions (the number specified per filter by the *nHashFuncs* field). Instead of using up to 50 different hash function implementations, a single implementation is used with a unique seed value for each function.\n\nThe seed is `nHashNum * 0xfba4c795 + nTweak` as a *uint32\\_t*, where the values are:\n\n* **nHashNum** is the sequence number for this hash function, starting at 0 for the first hash iteration and increasing up to the value of the *nHashFuncs* field (minus one) for the last hash iteration.\n\n* **0xfba4c795** is a constant optimized to create large differences in the seed for different values of *nHashNum*.\n\n* **nTweak** is a per-filter constant set by the client to require the use of an arbitrary set of hash functions.\n\nIf the seed resulting from the formula above is larger than four bytes, it must be truncated to its four most significant bytes (for example, `0x8967452301 & 0xffffffff \u2192 0x67452301`).\n\nThe actual hash function implementation used is the [32-bit Murmur3 hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash).\n\n> \ud83d\udea7 Murmer3 Version\n>\n> **Warning:** the Murmur3 hash function has separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions that produce different results for the same <<glossary:input>>.  Only the 32-bit Murmur3 version is used with Dash bloom filters.\n\nThe data to be hashed can be any transaction element which the bloom filter can match. See the next subsection for the list of transaction elements checked against the filter. The largest element which can be matched is a script data push of 520 bytes, so the data should never exceed 520 bytes.\n\nThe example below from Dash Core [bloom.cpp](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/v0.15.x/src/bloom.cpp#L59) combines all the steps above to create the hash function template. The seed is the first parameter; the data to be hashed is the second parameter. The result is a uint32\\_t modulo the size of the bit field in bits.\n\n``` c++\nMurmurHash3(nHashNum * 0xFBA4C795 + nTweak, vDataToHash) % (vData.size() * 8)\n```\n\nEach data element to be added to the filter is hashed by *nHashFuncs* number of hash functions. Each time a hash function is run, the result will be the index number (*nIndex*) of a bit in the bit field. That bit must be set to 1. For example if the filter bit field was `00000000` and the result is 5, the revised filter bit field is `00000100` (the first bit is bit 0).\n\nIt is expected that sometimes the same index number will be returned more than once when populating the bit field; this does not affect the algorithm---after a bit is set to 1, it is never changed back to 0.\n\nAfter all data elements have been added to the filter, each set of eight bits is converted into a little-endian byte. These bytes are the value of the *filter* field.\n\n## Comparing Transaction Elements To A Bloom Filter\n\nTo compare an arbitrary data element against the bloom filter, it is hashed using the same parameters used to create the bloom filter. Specifically, it is hashed *nHashFuncs* times, each time using the same\n*nTweak* provided in the filter, and the resulting <<glossary:output>> is modulo the size of the bit field provided in the *filter* field.  After each hash is performed, the filter is checked to see if the bit at that indexed location is set.  For example if the result of a hash is `5` and the filter is `01001110`, the bit is considered set.\n\nIf the result of every hash points to a set bit, the filter matches. If any of the results points to an unset bit, the filter does not match.\n\nThe following transaction elements are compared against bloom filters. All elements will be hashed in the byte order used in <<glossary:blocks>> (for example, <<glossary:TXIDs>> will be in <<glossary:internal byte order>>).\n\n* **TXIDs:** the transaction's SHA256(SHA256()) hash.\n\n* **Outpoints:** each 36-byte <<glossary:outpoint>> used this transaction's input section is individually compared to the filter.\n\n* **Signature Script Data:** each element pushed onto the stack by a <<glossary:data-pushing opcode>> in a <<glossary:signature script>> from this transaction is individually compared to the filter.  This includes data elements present in P2SH <<glossary:redeem script>> when they are being spent.\n\n* **PubKey Script Data:** each element pushed onto the the stack by a data-pushing opcode in any <<glossary:pubkey script>> from this transaction is individually compared to the filter. (If a pubkey script element matches the filter, the filter will be immediately updated if the `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL` flag was set; if the pubkey script is in the P2PKH format and matches the filter, the filter will be immediately updated if the `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY` flag was set. See the subsection below for details.)\n\nAs of  Dash Core 0.14.0, elements in the extra payload section of [DIP2](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md)-based <<glossary:special transactions>> are also compared against bloom filters.\n\nThe following annotated hexdump of a transaction is from the [raw transaction format section](core-ref-transactions-raw-transaction-format); the elements which would be checked by the filter are emphasized in bold. Note that this transaction's TXID (**`01000000017b1eab[...]`**) would also be checked, and that the outpoint TXID and index number below would be checked as a single 36-byte element.\n\n<pre><code>01000000 ...................................

When the filtering node sees a <<glossary:pubkey script>> that pays a pubkey, <<glossary:address>>, or other data element matching the filter, the filtering node immediately updates the filter with the <<glossary:outpoint>> corresponding to that pubkey script.\n\n![Automatically Updating Bloom Filters](https://dash-docs.github.io/img/dev/en-bloom-update.svg)\n\nIf an input later spends that outpoint, the filter will match it, allowing the filtering node to tell the client that one of its transaction outputs has been spent.\n\nThe *nFlags* field has three allowed values:\n\n| Value | Name                       | Description\n|-------|----------------------------|---------------\n| 0     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_NONE`          | The filtering node should not update the filter.\n| 1     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL`           | If the filter matches any data element in a pubkey script, the corresponding outpoint is added to the filter.\n| 2     | `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY` | If the filter matches any data element in a pubkey script and that script is either a P2PKH or non-P2SH pay-to-multisig script, the corresponding outpoint is added to the filter.\n\nIn addition, because the filter size stays the same even though additional elements are being added to it, the false positive rate increases. Each false positive can result in another element being added to the filter, creating a feedback loop that can (after a certain point) make the filter useless. For this reason, clients using automatic filter updates need to monitor the actual false positive rate and send a new filter when the rate gets too high.\n\n# getaddr\n\nThe [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr) requests an [`addr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) from the receiving <<glossary:node>>, preferably one with lots of IP addresses of other receiving nodes. The transmitting node can use those IP addresses to quickly update its database of available nodes rather than waiting for unsolicited [`addr` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#addr) to arrive over time.\n\nThere is no payload in a [`getaddr` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getaddr).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# getsporks\n\nThe [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks) requests [`spork` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) from the receiving node.\n\nThere is no payload in a [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# ping\n\nThe [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) helps confirm that the receiving <<glossary:peer>> is still connected. If a TCP/IP error is encountered when sending the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) (such as a connection timeout), the transmitting node can assume that the receiving node is disconnected. The response to a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) is the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong).\n\nBefore protocol version 60000, the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) had no payload. As of protocol version 60001 and all later versions, the message includes a single field, the nonce.\n\n| Bytes | Name  | Data Type | Description\n|-------|-------|-----------|---------------\n| 8     | nonce | uint64_t  | *Added in protocol version 60001 as described by BIP31.* <br><br>Random nonce assigned to this [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping).  The responding [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) will include this nonce to identify the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) to which it is replying.\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping). (The message header has been omitted.)\n\n``` text\n0094102111e2af4d ...

Dash Core will, by default, disconnect from any clients which have not responded to a [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) within 20 minutes.\n\nTo allow nodes to keep track of latency, the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) sends back the same nonce received in the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping) it is replying to.\n\nThe format of the [`pong` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#pong) is identical to the [`ping` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#ping); only the message header differs.\n\n# sendaddrv2\n\n*Added in protocol version 70220 of Dash Core*\n\nThe `sendaddrv2` message signals support for receiving [`addrv2` messages](#addrv2) (defined in [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki)). It also implies that its sender can encode as `addrv2` and would send `addrv2` messages instead of [`addr` messages](#addr) to a peer that has signaled `addrv2` support by sending a `sendaddrv2` message.\n\nThere is no payload in a `sendaddrv2` message. See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# sendcmpct\n\n*Added in protocol version 70209 of Dash Core as described by BIP152*\n\nThe [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> whether or not to announce new <<glossary:blocks>> using a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock). It also sends the compact block protocol version it supports. The [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) is defined as a message containing a 1-byte integer followed by a 8-byte integer. The first integer is interpreted as a boolean and should have a value of either 1 or 0. The second integer is be interpreted as a little-endian version number.\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the first and second integers set to 1, the <<glossary:node>> should announce new blocks by sending a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock).\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the first integer set to 0, the node shouldn't announce new blocks by sending a [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock), but instead announce new blocks by sending invs or <<glossary:headers>>, as defined by [BIP130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki).\n\nUpon receipt of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with the second integer set to something other than 1, nodes should treat the peer as if they had not received the message (as it indicates the peer will provide an unexpected encoding in [`cmpctblock` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock), and/or other, messages). This allows future versions to send duplicate [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) with different versions as a part of a version handshake.\n\nNodes should check for a protocol version of >= 70209 before sending [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct). Nodes shouldn't send a request for a `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` object to a peer before having received a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) from that peer. Nodes shouldn't request a `MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK` object before having sent all [`sendcmpct` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) to that peer which they intend to send, as the peer cannot know what protocol version to use in the response.\n\nThe structure of a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct) is defined below.\n\n| Bytes    | Name          | Data Type        | Description\n|----------|---------------|------------------|--------------\n| 1        | announce      | bool             | 0 - Announce blocks via [`headers` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#headers) or [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv)<br>1 - Announce blocks via [`cmpctblock` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#cmpctblock)\n| 8        | version       | uint64_t         | The compact block protocol version number\n\nThe annotated hexdump below shows a [`sendcmpct` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendcmpct).

See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# sendheaders2\n\n*Added in protocol version 70223 of Dash Core.*\n\nThe [`sendheaders2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendheaders2) tells the receiving <<glossary:peer>> to send new <<glossary:block>> announcements using a [`headers2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#headers2) rather than an [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv).\n\nThere is no payload in a [`sendheaders2` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#sendheaders2).  See the [message header section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers) for an example of a message without a payload.\n\n# spork\n\nSporks are a mechanism by which updated code is released to the network, but not immediately made active (or \u201cenforced\u201d). Enforcement of the updated code can be activated remotely. Should problems arise, the code can be deactivated in the same manner, without the need for a network-wide rollback or client update.\n\nA [`spork` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) may be sent in response to a [`getsporks` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#getsporks).\n\nThe [`spork` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#spork) tells the receiving peer the status of the spork defined by the SporkID field.

The [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack) has no payload; for an example of a message with no payload, see the [message headers section](core-ref-p2p-network-message-headers).\n\n# version\n\nThe [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) provides information about the transmitting <<glossary:node>> to the receiving node at the beginning of a connection. Until both <<glossary:peers>> have exchanged [`version` messages](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version), no other messages will be accepted.\n\nIf a [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version) is accepted, the receiving node should send a [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack)---but no node should send a [`verack` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#verack) before initializing its half of the connection by first sending a [`version` message](core-ref-p2p-network-control-messages#version).\n\nProtocol version 70214 added a <<glossary:masternode>> authentication (challenge/response) system.
