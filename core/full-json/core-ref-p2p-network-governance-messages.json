Object Sync - When a masternode receives a [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) with a hash of all zeros, it responds with a [`ssc` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#ssc) for `govobj` objects. The masternode also sends an [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv) (MSG_GOVERNANCE_OBJECT - 0x17) for all valid `govobj` governance objects.\n*Governance object votes are excluded in this type of response.*\n\n2. Vote Sync - When a masternode receives a [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) with a specific hash, it responds with an [`ssc` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#ssc) for `govobjvote` objects. The masternode also sends a `govobjvote` inventory messages (MSG_GOVERNANCE_OBJECT_VOTE - 0x18) for the object requested.\n\n| Bytes | Name | Data type | Required | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 32 | nHash | uint256 | Required | Hash of governance object to request<br>Set to all zeros to request all objects (excludes votes)\n| # | filter | CBloomFilter | Required | Can be set to all zeros.<br>Only supported since [protocol version 70206](core-ref-p2p-network-protocol-versions)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 Object sync rate limiting\n>\n> Dash Core limits how frequently the first type of sync (object sync) can be requested.

Masternode BLS Signature\n```\n\n# govsync\n\nThe [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) is used to request syncing of governance objects (`govobj` message and [`govobjvote` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govobjvote)) with peers. <<glossary:Masternodes>> ignore this request if they are not fully synced.\n\nThis message responds in one of two ways depending on the request:\n\n1. Object Sync - When a masternode receives a [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) with a hash of all zeros, it responds with a [`ssc` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#ssc) for `govobj` objects. The masternode also sends an [`inv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-data-messages#inv) (MSG_GOVERNANCE_OBJECT - 0x17) for all valid `govobj` governance objects.\n*Governance object votes are excluded in this type of response.*\n\n2. Vote Sync - When a masternode receives a [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync) with a specific hash, it responds with an [`ssc` message](core-ref-p2p-network-masternode-messages#ssc) for `govobjvote` objects. The masternode also sends a `govobjvote` inventory messages (MSG_GOVERNANCE_OBJECT_VOTE - 0x18) for the object requested.\n\n| Bytes | Name | Data type | Required | Description |\n| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 32 | nHash | uint256 | Required | Hash of governance object to request<br>Set to all zeros to request all objects (excludes votes)\n| # | filter | CBloomFilter | Required | Can be set to all zeros.<br>Only supported since [protocol version 70206](core-ref-p2p-network-protocol-versions)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 Object sync rate limiting\n>\n> Dash Core limits how frequently the first type of sync (object sync) can be requested. Frequent requests will result in the node being banned.\n\nThe following annotated hexdump shows a [`govsync` message](core-ref-p2p-network-governance-messages#govsync). (The message header has been omitted.)\n\n``` text\n2e46ea5418e097a3dbcccbee3cf2a911\n6fb94ba635153f276dcb2123efcb73ff ..... Hash\n00000000000000000000 ................. Bloom Filter\n```"
