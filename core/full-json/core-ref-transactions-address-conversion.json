 "body": "The hashes used in P2PKH and <<glossary:P2SH outputs>> are commonly encoded as Dash <<glossary:addresses>>.  This is the procedure to encode those hashes and decode the addresses.\n\n# Conversion Process\n\nFirst, get your hash.  For P2PKH, you RIPEMD-160(SHA256()) hash a ECDSA <<glossary:public key>> derived from your 256-bit ECDSA <<glossary:private key>> (random data). For P2SH, you RIPEMD-160(SHA256()) hash a <<glossary:redeem script>> serialized in the format used in <<glossary:raw transactions>> (described in a [following sub-section](core-ref-transactions-raw-transaction-format)).  Taking the resulting hash:\n\n1. Add an <<glossary:address>> version byte in front of the hash.  The version bytes commonly used by Dash are:\n\n    * 0x4c for <<glossary:P2PKH addresses>> on the main Dash network (<<glossary:mainnet>>)\n\n    * 0x8c for <<glossary:P2PKH addresses>> on the Dash testing network (<<glossary:testnet>>)\n\n    * 0x10 for <<glossary:P2SH addresses>> on <<glossary:mainnet>>\n\n    * 0x13 for <<glossary:P2SH addresses>> on <<glossary:testnet>>\n\n2. Create a copy of the version and hash; then hash that twice with SHA256: `SHA256(SHA256(version . hash))`\n\n3. Extract the first four bytes from the double-hashed copy. These are used as a checksum to ensure the base hash gets transmitted correctly.\n\n4. Append the checksum to the version and hash, and encode it as a <<glossary:base58>> string: `BASE58(version . hash . checksum)`\n\n# Example Code\nDash's base58 encoding, called <<glossary:Base58Check>> may not match other implementations.
