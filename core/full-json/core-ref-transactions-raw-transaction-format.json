It is this form of a transaction which is SHA256(SHA256()) hashed to create the <<glossary:TXID>> and, ultimately, the <<glossary:merkle root>> of a <<glossary:block>> containing the transaction---making the transaction format part of the <<glossary:consensus rules>>.\n\nDash Core and many other tools print and accept <<glossary:raw transactions>> encoded as hex.\n\nTransactions prior to protocol version 70209 defaulted to version 1. Transaction version 2 was the default in protocol versions => 70209 and < 70213. Version 2 transactions have the same format, but the `lock_time` parameter was redefined by [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) to enable relative lock-times. (Note: transactions in the <<glossary:block chain>> are allowed to list a higher version number to permit <<glossary:soft forks>>, but they are treated as version 2 transactions by current software.)\n\nDash Core 0.13.0 (protocol version 70213) introduced transaction version 3 as part of the [DIP2 - Special Transactions](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md) implementation. Details of the changes introduced by this feature and currently implemented <<glossary:special transactions>> can be found in the [Special Transactions section](core-ref-transactions-special-transactions) below as well as in the [DIP](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md).\n\nA raw transaction has the following top-level format:\n\n| Bytes    | Name         | Data Type           | Description\n|----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------\n| 2        | version      | uint16_t            | *Converted from 4 bytes to 2 bytes by DIP2 in v0.13.0*<br><br>Transaction version number; currently version 3.

The coinbase <<glossary:input>> currently has the following format.\n\n| Bytes    | Name               | Data Type            | Description\n|----------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------\n| 32       | hash (null)        | char[32]             | A 32-byte null, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.\n| 4        | index (UINT32_MAX) | uint32_t             | 0xffffffff, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.\n| *Varies* | script bytes       | compactSize uint     | The number of bytes in the coinbase script, up to a maximum of 100 bytes.\n| *Varies* (4) | height         | script               | The <<glossary:block height>> of this block as required by BIP34.  Uses script language: starts with a data-pushing opcode that indicates how many bytes to push to the stack followed by the block height as a little-endian unsigned integer.  This script must be as short as possible, otherwise it may be rejected.<br><br>  The data-pushing opcode will be 0x03 and the total size four bytes until block 16,777,216 about 300 years from now.\n| *Varies* | coinbase script    | *None*               | The <<glossary:coinbase field>>: Arbitrary data not exceeding 100 bytes minus the (4) height bytes.  Miners commonly place an extra nonce in this field to update the block header merkle root during hashing.\n| 4        | sequence           | uint32_t             | Sequence number.\n\nAlthough the coinbase script is arbitrary data, if it includes the bytes used by any signature-checking operations such as [`OP_CHECKSIG`](core-ref-transactions-opcodes), those signature checks will be counted as signature operations (sigops) towards the block's sigop limit.  To avoid this, you can prefix all data with the appropriate push operation.\n\nAn itemized <<glossary:coinbase transaction>>:\n\n``` text\n01000000 ..............................

The coinbase <<glossary:input>> currently has the following format.\n\n| Bytes    | Name               | Data Type            | Description\n|----------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------\n| 32       | hash (null)        | char[32]             | A 32-byte null, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.\n| 4        | index (UINT32_MAX) | uint32_t             | 0xffffffff, as a coinbase has no previous outpoint.\n| *Varies* | script bytes       | compactSize uint     | The number of bytes in the coinbase script, up to a maximum of 100 bytes.\n| *Varies* (4) | height         | script               | The <<glossary:block height>> of this block as required by BIP34.  Uses script language: starts with a data-pushing opcode that indicates how many bytes to push to the stack followed by the block height as a little-endian unsigned integer.  This script must be as short as possible, otherwise it may be rejected.<br><br>  The data-pushing opcode will be 0x03 and the total size four bytes until block 16,777,216 about 300 years from now.\n| *Varies* | coinbase script    | *None*               | The <<glossary:coinbase field>>: Arbitrary data not exceeding 100 bytes minus the (4) height bytes.  Miners commonly place an extra nonce in this field to update the block header merkle root during hashing.\n| 4        | sequence           | uint32_t             | Sequence number.\n\nAlthough the coinbase script is arbitrary data, if it includes the bytes used by any signature-checking operations such as [`OP_CHECKSIG`](core-ref-transactions-opcodes), those signature checks will be counted as signature operations (sigops) towards the block's sigop limit.  To avoid this, you can prefix all data with the appropriate push operation.\n\nAn itemized <<glossary:coinbase transaction>>:\n\n``` text\n01000000 ..............................

Superblocks ([superblock example](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/block.dws?731104.htm)) have multiple outputs depending on the number of proposals being funded."
