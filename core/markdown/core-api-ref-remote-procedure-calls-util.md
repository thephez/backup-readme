# CreateMultiSig

The [`createmultisig` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-util#section-create-multi-sig) creates a P2SH multi-signature address.

*Parameter #1---the number of signatures required*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Required | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The minimum (*m*) number of signatures required to spend this m-of-n multisig script

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Keys Or Addresses | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array of strings with each string being a public key or address
→<br>Key Or Address | string | Required<br>(1 or more) | A public key against which signatures will be checked.  If wallet support is enabled, this may be a P2PKH address belonging to the wallet---the corresponding public key will be substituted.  There must be at least as many keys as specified by the Required parameter, and there may be more keys

*Result---P2SH address and hex-encoded redeem script*

Name | Type | Presence | Description

# VerifyMessage

The [`verifymessage` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-util#section-verify-message) verifies a signed message.

*Parameter #1---the address corresponding to the signing key*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Address | string (base58) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The P2PKH address corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  A P2PKH address is a hash of the public key corresponding to the private key which made the signature.  When the ECDSA signature is checked, up to four possible ECDSA public keys will be reconstructed from from the signature; each key will be hashed and compared against the P2PKH address provided to see if any of them match.  If there are no matches, signature validation will fail

*Parameter #2---the signature*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Signature | string (base64) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The signature created by the signer encoded as base-64 (the format output by the [`signmessage` RPC](core-api-ref-remote-procedure-calls-wallet#section-sign-message))

*Parameter #3---the message*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Message | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The message exactly as it was signed (e.g. no extra whitespace)

*Result: `true`, `false`, or an error*

Name | Type | Presence | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`result` | boolean | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` if the message was signed by a key corresponding to the provided P2PKH address; set to `false` if it was not signed by that key; set to JSON `null` if an error occurred

*Example from Dash Core 0.12.2*

Check the signature on the message created in the example for
`signmessage`:

``` bash
dash-cli -testnet verifymessage \
  yNpezfFDfoikDuT1f4iK75AiLp2YLPsGAb \
  H4XULzfHCf16In2ECk9Ta9QxQPq639zQto2JA3OLlo3JbUdrClvJ89+A1z+Z9POd6l8LJhn1jGpQYF8mX4jkQvE= \
  'Hello, World!'
```

Result:

``` json
true
```
