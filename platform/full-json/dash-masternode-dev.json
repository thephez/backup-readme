 "body": "The purpose of this tutorial is to walk through the steps necessary to set up a masternode with Dash Platform services using an unreleased development version of the project.\n\n# Prerequisites\n- Access to a Linux system configured with a non-root user ([guide](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/masternodes/setup.html#set-up-your-vps))\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) (v20.10.0+) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v1.25.0+) installed\n- An installation of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12+\n- A copy of the [platform repository](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 \n>\n> More comprehensive details of using the dashmate tool can be found in the [dashmate README](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/dashmate).\n\nClone a copy of the platform repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/dashpay/platform.git\ncd platform\n```\n\n# Local Development Network\n\nDashmate can be used to create a local development network (devnet) containing multiple nodes to mimic conditions and features found in testnet/mainnet settings.\n\n## Setup\n\nRun the following command to setup a local network:\n\n```shell\nyarn setup\n```\n\n## Operation\n\nOnce the setup completes, start/stop/restart the network via the following commands:\n\n```shell\nyarn start\nyarn stop\nyarn restart\n```\n\nThe status of the network's nodes can be check via the group status command:\n\n```shell\nyarn exec packages/dashmate/bin/dashmate group:status\n```\n\n## Mining Dash\n\nDuring development it may be necessary to obtain Dash to create and topup [identities](docs/explanation-identity). This can be done using the dashmate `wallet:mint` command. First obtain an address to fund via the [Create and Fund a Wallet](doc:tutorial-create-and-fund-a-wallet) tutorial and then mine Dash to it as shown below:\n\n```shell Mine to provided address\n# Stop the devnet first\nyarn stop\n\n# Mine 10 Dash to a provided address\nyarn exec packages/dashmate/bin/dashmate wallet:mint 10 --address=<your address> --config=local_seed\n\n# Restart the devnet\nyarn start\n```\n```shell Mine to new address\n# Stop the devnet first\nyarn stop\n\n# Mine 10 Dash to a random address/key\n# The address and private key will be displayed\nyarn exec packages/dashmate/bin/dashmate wallet:mint 10 --config=local_seed\n\n# Restart the devnet\nyarn start\n```\nExample output of `yarn exec packages/dashmate/bin/dashmate wallet:mint 10 --address=yWTXCoGjH4HDpo5cnGJcBHYFnjncf6gzuL --config=local_seed`:\n\n```text\n\u2714 Generate 10 dash to address\n  \u2714 Start Core\n  \u2193 Use specified address yWTXCoGjH4HDpo5cnGJcBHYFnjncf6gzuL [SKIPPED]\n  \u2714 Generate \u224810 dash to address yWTXCoGjH4HDpo5cnGJcBHYFnjncf6gzuL\n    \u203a Generated 172.59038279 dash\n  \u2714 Wait for balance to confirm\n  \u2714 Stop Core\n```\n\n## Using the devnet\n\nOnce the address is funded, you can begin creating identities, data contracts, etc. and experimenting with Dash Platform. The [other tutorials](tutorials-introduction) in this section will help you get started.\n\nTo make the Dash SDK connect to your local development network, set the `network` option to `'local'` and set the DPNS contract ID when configuring your client. The DPNS contract ID can be found in the `packages/platform-test-suite/.env` file.\n\n```js\nconst clientOpts = {\n  network: 'local',\n  // Set DPNS contract ID to the one output during setup\n  apps: {\n    dpns: {\n      contractId: 'DPNS contract ID displayed during the setup step',\n    },\n  },\n  ...\n};\n\nconst client = new Dash.Client(clientOpts);\n...\n```\n\n# Remote Development Network\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 Connecting to a remote development network\n>\n> In order to connect to a remote devnet (e.g. one run by Dash Core Group), please use one of the methods described in the [Connect to a Devnet](tutorial-connecting-to-testnet#connect-to-a-devnet) section.\n\nFor development we recommend using either a local development network created via dashmate as [described above](#local-development-network) or using Testnet. While configuring a remote development network is possible using the Dash network deployment tool, it is beyond the scope of this documentation. For details regarding this tool, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dashevo/dash-network-deploy).\n\n\n# Testnet Masternode Setup\n\n>\u2757\ufe0f Advanced Topic\n>\n> Running a masternode requires familiarity with Dash Platform services. Improper configuration may impact testing so please exercise caution if running a masternode.\n\nTo setup a testnet masternode, please refer to the comprehensive documentation of the process as described [here](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/masternodes/setup-testnet.html#dashmate-installation). The following video also details how to complete the process.\n[block:html]\n{\n  \"html\": \"<div></div>\\n\\n<style></style>\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LLiMMXSAfeU?rel=0&modestbranding=1\\\" title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\"\n}\n[/block]",
