 "body": "## Core concepts\n\nThe [Dash Core Developer Guide](https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-guide-introduction) will answer most of questions about the fundamentals of Dash. However, some elements provided by the SDK need to be grasped, so we will quickly cover some of those.\n\n## Wallet\n\nAt the core of Dash is the Payment Chain. In order to be able to transact on it, one needs to have a set of [UTXOs](https://dashcore.readme.io/docs/core-guide-block-chain-transaction-data) that are controlled by a Wallet instance.\n\nIn order to access your UTXO, you will have to provide a valid mnemonic that will unlock the Wallet and automatically fetch the associated UTXOs.\n\nWhen an SDK instance is created, you can access your wallet via the `client.wallet` variable. (Check [wallet-lib documentation](https://dashpay.github.io/platform/Wallet-library/) for more details)\n\n## Account\n\nSince the introduction of deterministic wallets ([BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)), a wallet is represented by multiple accounts.\n\nIt is the instance you will use most of the time for receiving or broadcasting payments.\n\nYou can access your account with `client.getWalletAccount()`. See [how to use a different account](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs/dash-sdk-examples-use-different-account) if you need to get an account at a specific index.\n\n## App Schema and Contracts\n\nThe Dash Platform Chain provides developers with the ability to create applications.  \nEach application requires a set of rules and conditions described as a portable document in the form of a JSON Schema.\n\nWhen registered, those applications schemas are called contracts and contains a contractId (namespace : `client.platform.contracts`).\n\nBy default, this library supports Dash Platform Name Service (DPNS) (to attach a name to an identity), under the namespace `client.platform.names` for testnet.  \n\nSee: [how to use multiple apps](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs/dash-sdk-getting-started-working-with-multiple-apps)",
