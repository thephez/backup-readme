 "body": "# Overview\n\nHistorically, nodes in most cryptocurrency networks communicated with each other, and the outside world, according to a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol. The use of P2P protocols presented some downsides for developers, namely, network resources were difficult to access without specialized knowledge or trusted third-party services.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the Dash decentralized API (DAPI) uses Dash's robust masternode infrastructure to provide an API for accessing the network. DAPI supports both layer 1 (Core blockchain) and layer 2 (Dash Platform) functionality so all developers can interact with Dash via a single interface.\n\n[block:image]\n{\n  \"images\": [\n    {\n      \"image\": [\n        \"https://files.readme.io/e011783-Decentralized_API_DAPI.svg\",\n        \"Decentralized API (DAPI).svg\",\n        613\n      ],\n      \"align\": \"center\",\n      \"caption\": \"DAPI Overview\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n[/block]\n\n# Security\n\nDAPI protects connections by using TLS to encrypt communication between clients and the masternodes. This encryption safeguards transmitted data from unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. [Platform gRPC endpoints](reference-dapi-endpoints-platform-endpoints) provide an additional level of security by optionally returning cryptographic proofs. Successful proof verification guarantees that the server responded without modifying the requested data.\n\n# Endpoint Overview\n\nDAPI currently provides 2 types of endpoints: [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/). The JSON-RPC endpoints expose some layer 1 information while the gRPC endpoints support layer 2 as well as streaming of events related to blocks and transactions/transitions. For a list of all endpoints and usage details, please see the [DAPI endpoint reference section](reference-dapi-endpoints).",
