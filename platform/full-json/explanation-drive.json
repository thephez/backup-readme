 "body": "# Overview\n\nUsing the traditional, layer 1 blockchain for data storage is widely known to be expensive and inefficient. Consequently, data for Dash Platform applications is stored in Drive, a layer 2 component that provides decentralized storage hosted by masternodes. As data changes over time, Drive maintains a record of the current state of each item to support easy retrieval using [DAPI](explanation-dapi).\n\n# Details\n\n## Drive Components\n\nThere are a number of components working together to facilitate Drive's overall functionality. These components are listed below along with a brief description of service they provide:\n\n - [Platform chain](explanation-drive-platform-chain) (orders state transitions; creates and propagates blocks of state transitions)\n - Platform state machine (validates data against the [Dash platform protocol](explanation-platform-protocol); applies data to state and storage)\n - [Platform state](explanation-drive-platform-state) (represents current data)\n - Storage (record of state transitions)\n\n## Data Update Process\n\nThe process of adding or updating data in Drive consists of several steps to ensure data is validated, propagated, and stored properly. This description provides a simplified overview of the process:\n\n1. [State transitions](explanation-platform-protocol-state-transition) are submitted to the platform via [DAPI](explanation-dapi)\n2. DAPI sends the state transitions to the platform chain where they are validated, ordered, and committed to a block\n3. Valid state transitions are applied to the platform state\n4. The platform chain propagates a block containing the state transitions\n5.
