Consequently, data for Dash Platform applications is stored in Drive, a layer 2 component that provides decentralized storage hosted by masternodes. As data changes over time, Drive maintains a record of the current state of each item to support easy retrieval using [DAPI](explanation-dapi).\n\n# Details\n\n## Drive Components\n\nThere are a number of components working together to facilitate Drive's overall functionality. These components are listed below along with a brief description of service they provide:\n\n - [Platform chain](explanation-drive-platform-chain) (orders state transitions; creates and propagates blocks of state transitions)\n - Platform state machine (validates data against the [Dash platform protocol](explanation-platform-protocol); applies data to state and storage)\n - [Platform state](explanation-drive-platform-state) (represents current data)\n - Storage (record of state transitions)\n\n## Data Update Process\n\nThe process of adding or updating data in Drive consists of several steps to ensure data is validated, propagated, and stored properly. This description provides a simplified overview of the process:\n\n1. [State transitions](explanation-platform-protocol-state-transition) are submitted to the platform via [DAPI](explanation-dapi)\n2. DAPI sends the state transitions to the platform chain where they are validated, ordered, and committed to a block\n3. Valid state transitions are applied to the platform state\n4. The platform chain propagates a block containing the state transitions\n5. Receiving nodes update Drive data based on the valid state transitions in the block\n[block:image]\n{\n  \"images\": [\n    {\n      \"image\": [\n        \"https://files.readme.io/5e35fd4-Drive.svg\",\n        \"Drive.svg\",\n        612,\n        492,\n        \"#fafafc\"\n      ],\n      \"caption\": \"Storing data in Drive\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n[/block]",
