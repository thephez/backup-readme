As with Tendermint, Tenderdash provides Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State Machine Replication via blocks containing transactions. Additionally, it is being updated to integrate some improvements that leverage Dash's long-living masternode quorums (LLMQ).\n\n## Validator Set Rotation\n\nRather than having a static validator set, Tenderdash will periodically change to a new set of validator nodes. These validator sets are comprised of a subset of masternodes that are members of one of the 100 member long-living masternode quorums (LLMQs). This rotation process balances the performance and security of platform chain like InstantSend and ChainLock quorum changes do on the core chain.\n\n## Threshold Signing\n\nTenderdash also takes advantage of LLMQ BLS threshold signing to produce block signatures for platform chain. This results in more compact block headers since only a single BLS threshold signature is required instead of individual signatures from each validator. Notably this means that the block signatures can be easily verified by any client using the deterministic masternode list.",
