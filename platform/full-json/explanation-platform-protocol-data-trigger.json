Certain system data contracts may require server-side validation logic to operate effectively. For example, [DPNS](doc:explanation-dpns) must enforce some rules to ensure names remain DNS compatible. [Dash Platform Protocol](explanation-platform-protocol) (DPP) supports this application-specific custom logic using Data Triggers.\n\n> \u2757\ufe0f Constraints\n> \n> Given a number of technical considerations (security, masternode processing capacity, etc.), data triggers are not considered a platform feature at this time. They are currently hard-coded in Dash Platform Protocol and only used in system data contracts.\n\n# Details\n\nSince all application data is submitted in the form of documents, data triggers are defined in the context of documents. To provide even more granularity, they also incorporate the document `action` so separate triggers can be created for the `CREATE`, `REPLACE`, or `DELETE` actions.\n\nAs an example, DPP contains several [data triggers for DPNS](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dpp/lib/dataTrigger/). The `domain` document has added constraints for creation. All DPNS document types have constraints on replacing or deleting:\n\n| Data Contract | Document | Action(s) | Trigger Description |\n| - | - | - |\n| DPNS | `domain` | [`CREATE`](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/blob/master/packages/js-dpp/lib/dataTrigger/dpnsTriggers/createDomainDataTrigger.js) | Enforces DNS compatibility, validate provided hashes, and restrict top-level domain (TLD) registration |\n| ---- | ----| ---- | ---- |\n| DPNS | All Document Types | [`REPLACE`](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/blob/master/packages/js-dpp/lib/dataTrigger/rejectDataTrigger.js) | Prevents updates to any DPNS document type |\n| DPNS | All Document Types | [`DELETE`](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/blob/master/packages/js-dpp/lib/dataTrigger/rejectDataTrigger.js) | Prevents deletion of any DPNS document type |\n\nWhen document state transitions are received, DPP checks if there is a trigger associated with the document type and action. If a trigger is found, DPP executes the trigger logic. Successful execution of the trigger logic is necessary for the document to be accepted and applied to the [platform state](explanation-drive-platform-state).",
