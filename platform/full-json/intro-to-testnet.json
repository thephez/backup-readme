As a testing network, Testnet may be subject to occasional updates and changes that break backwards compatibility.\n\n# Network Details\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nDash Core Group provides the core Testnet infrastructure consisting of 150 masternodes running Dash Core along with the platform services that provide the [decentralized API (DAPI)](explanation-dapi) and [storage (Drive)](explanation-drive) functionality.\n\nTestnet also includes a [block explorer](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/) for the core blockchain and a [test Dash faucet](https://testnet-faucet.dash.org/) that dispenses funds to users/developers experimenting on the network.\n\n## Features\n\nThe Dash Platform features available on testnet include:\n\n- [Dash Platform Name Service](explanation-dpns) (DPNS): a data contract and supporting logic for name registration\n- [Identities](explanation-identity): creation of identities\n- [Names](explanation-dpns): creation of DPNS names that link to an identity\n- [Data Contracts](doc:explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract): creation of data contracts\n- [Documents](doc:explanation-platform-protocol-document): used to store/update/delete data associated with data contracts\n- [DashPay](explanation-dashpay): a data contract enableing a decentralized application that creates bidirectional direct settlement payment channels between identities and supports contact (name) based payments\n\n# Getting involved\n\nThis network is open for all who are interested in testing and interacting with Dash Platform.
