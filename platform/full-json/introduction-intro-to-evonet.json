This marks the first release of the core Dash Platform components in a freely accessible network. \n[block:callout]\n{\n  \"type\": \"warning\",\n  \"body\": \"As a development network, Evonet may be subject to frequent updates and changes that break backwards compatibility.\",\n  \"title\": \"Evonet Stability\"\n}\n[/block]\n\n# Network Details\n\n## Infrastructure\nDash Core Group provides the core Evonet infrastructure consisting of 50 masternodes running Dash Core along with the platform services that provide the [decentralized API (DAPI)](explanation-dapi) and [storage (Drive)](explanation-drive) functionality.\n\nEvonet also includes a [block explorer](http://insight.evonet.networks.dash.org:3001/insight/) for the core blockchain and a [test Dash faucet](http://faucet.evonet.networks.dash.org/) that dispenses funds to users/developers experimenting on the network.\n\n## Features\n\nWith this initial public release of the core Dash Platform components, the features available on the platform include:\n- [Dash Platform Name Service](explanation-dpns) (DPNS): a data contract and supporting logic for name registration\n- [Identities](explanation-identity): creation of identities\n- [Names](explanation-dpns): creation of DPNS names that link to an identity\n\nIn the near future, the DashPay data contract will also be registered on Evonet.\n\n[block:callout]\n{\n  \"type\": \"success\",\n  \"title\": \"Evonet Updated\",\n  \"body\": \"Registration of third-party data contracts is now enabled on Evonet. See this [tutorial](tutorial-register-a-data-contract) for details.\"\n}\n[/block]\n\n# Getting involved\n\nThis network is open for all who are interested in testing and interacting with Dash Platform.
