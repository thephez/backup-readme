Although one could interact with DAPI by connecting to these directly, or by using [DAPI-client](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dapi-client), the easiest approach is to use the [JavaScript Dash SDK](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dash-sdk).\n\n# Prerequisites\n- An installation of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 Minimum Supported Version\n>\n> Dash Platform only supports NodeJS v12 and higher\n\n# Connect via Dash SDK\n\n## 1. Install the Dash SDK\n\nThe JavaScript SDK package is available from npmjs.com and can be installed by running `npm install dash` (from the command line):\n\n```shell\nnpm install dash\n```\n\n## 2. Connect to Dash Platform\n\nCreate a file with the following contents. Then run it by typing `node <file.js>` (from the command line):\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 \n>\n> Currently the Dash SDK connects to Testnet by default.\n\n```javascript\nconst Dash = require('dash');\n\nconst client = new Dash.Client();\n\nasync function connect() {\n  return await client.getDAPIClient().core.getBestBlockHash();\n}\n\nconnect()\n  .then((d) => console.log('Connected. Best block hash:\\n', d))\n  .catch((e) => console.error('Something went wrong:\\n', e))\n  .finally(() => client.disconnect());\n```\n\nOnce this returns successfully, you're ready to begin developing!
