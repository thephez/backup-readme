Documents are submitted in batches that may contain multiple documents to be created, replaced, or deleted. In this example, a single document is being created. The `documentBatch` object defines the action to be completed for the document (the empty action arrays - `replace` and `delete` in this example - may be excluded and are shown for reference only here).\n\nThe `platform.documents.broadcast` method then takes the document batch and an identity parameter.
