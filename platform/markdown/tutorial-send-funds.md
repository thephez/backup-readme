# Overview

Once you have a wallet and some funds ([tutorial](tutorial-create-and-fund-a-wallet)), another common task is sending Dash to an address. (Sending Dash to a contact or a DPNS identity requires the Dashpay app, which has not been registered yet.)

# Code

> ðŸ“˜Wallet Operations
>
> The JavaScript SDK does not cache wallet information. It re-syncs the entire Core chain for some wallet operations (e.g. `client.getWalletAccount()`) which can result in wait times of  5+ minutes. 
>
> A future release will add caching so that access is much faster after the initial sync. For now, the `skipSynchronizationBeforeHeight` option can be used to sync the wallet starting at a certain block height.

# What's Happening

After initializing the Client, we build a new transaction with `account.createTransaction`. It requires a recipient and an amount in satoshis (often called "duffs" in Dash). 100 million satoshis equals one Dash. We pass the transaction to `account.broadcastTransaction` and wait for it to return. Then we output the result, which is a transaction ID. After that we disconnect from the Client so node can exit.
